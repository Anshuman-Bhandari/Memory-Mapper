                    Contiguous memory allocation assigns a single continuous block of memory to a process or file, ensuring that free memory is not scattered but located in one place.

                    <p>
                    Non-contiguous allocation, also known as dynamic or linked allocation, is a memory allocation technique used in operating systems to allocate memory to processes that do not require a contiguous block of memory.

                            <li>LRU (Least Recently Used): Replaces the page that hasnâ€™t been used for the longest

                    <p>
                    Buddy System is a memory allocation technique used in computer OS to allocate and manage memory efficiently. This technique by dividing the memory into fixed-size blocks, and whenever a process requests memory, the system finds the smallest available block that can accommodate the requested memory size.

                            <li>Fibonacci Buddy System : A Fibonacci buddy system has block sizes of 16, 32, 48, 80, 128, and 208 bytes</li>
                            <li>Binary Buddy System : The buddy system keeps track of the free blocks of each size (known as a free list) so that you can easily discover a block of the necessary size if one is available.</li>
                            <li>Worst Fit - Allocate the largest available block to reduce the chance of creating a small

                            <li>Weighted Buddy System: In a weighted peer system, each memory block is associated with a weight, which represents its size relative to other blocks. </li>
